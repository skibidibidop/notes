* BASIC CONCEPTS
	Declarative Knowledge
		Statement of fact, no instructions contained
		A computer will not be able to use this
		
	Imperative Knowledge
		Contains instructions on how to do something (algorithms)
		
	Syntax
		Defines which strings of characters and symbols are valid
		
	Static Semantics
		Defines which syntactically valid strings have meaning
		
	Semantics
		Associates a meaning with each syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors
		
	Interpreted
		Code is executed directly by an interpreter
		Usually easier to debug due to error messages that are easy to relate to the source code
		
	Compiled
		Code is converted to machine code first
		Usually faster and uses less space than interpreted
		
	Scalar objects
		Some of the most basic building blocks of a language
		Example: primitves
		
	Non-scalar objects
		Objects that have internal structure which can be accessed further
		Example: strings
		
	Expressions
		Combinations of objects and operators
