# VARIABLES
	Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
	Varable names can't start with numbers
	Don't use reserved words for variable names

# STRINGS
	A data type
	A series of characters
	Can be denoted with single quotes or double quotes

	Example of a quotation in a string:
		'They said "put quotation here"!'
	
	Example of apostrophe in string
		"This is an 'example'."

	Change to uppercase, lowercase, or Title Case using upper(), lower(), or title()
	
# VARIABLES IN STRINGS
	f-strings			: f stands for format
					: variables can be put inside f-strings

		final_var = f"{variable1} {variable2}"

		or

		printf(f"Hello, {final_var.title()}!")

# WHITESPACE
	\t				: tab
	\n				: newline

	Usage:
		print("Hi\t\n name")

	Remove whitespace using rstrip(), lstrip(), strip()

	Indentation matters syntactically in Python

# INTEGERS
	Operators: +, -, *, /, ** (exponents), parentheses
	Underscores can be used to make large numbers more readable:
		1000 is the same as 10_00 or 1_000
		Python will ignore the underscores
		This is applicable to all numbers in Python

# FLOATS
	Any number with decimal point
	Division always results to floats, even if the operands are both integers
	Mixing floats with integers in operations also results to floats

# CONSTANTS
	Use all capitals to indicate that a variable is constant
	
# LISTS
	Making list names plural is a good idea
	Similar to arrays, can also be accessed using indexes

	example = ['example1', 'example2', 'example3']
	example1 is at example[0]
	
	index -1 will return the last item in the list
	index -2 will return the second to the last item in the list
		, so on and so forth

	Can be used in f-strings
	Methods can be applied
		print(f"This is the item in the list: {example[0].upper()}.")

# MODIFYING LISTS
	append() can be used to add elements to the end of lists
	append() can also be used to add elements to an empty list
		listname.append('<item to append>')
	
	insert() can be used to add new elements to any position
		listname.insert(<index>, '<item to insert>')

	The del statement can be used to remove any element in a list
		del listname[<index number>]
	
	If the index number is not available, elements can be removed using remove()
		listname.remove('<item to remove>')
		# Only removes the first occurrence

	Elements can be popped off (removed but still available for use) lists with pop()
		popped_item = listname.pop(<index>)
		# The popped off item is in the variable popped_item

# ORGANIZING LISTS
	sort() sort alphabetically (default)
	sort(reverse=True) sorts in reverse alphabetical order
	sort cannot be udnone
		listname.sort()
			# Sorts the elements in the list
		print(listname)
			# Will print out alphabetically sorted list

	The function sorted() prints out sorted list but doesn't affect actual arrangement
		print(sorted(listname))
			# Will print out sorted list
			# Actual arrangement of list is not affected

	The method reverse() reverses the original sort of a list permanently
		listname = ['a', 'b', 'e', 'c', 'd']
		listname.reverse()
		print(listname)
			# will print out ['d', 'c', 'e', 'b', 'a']
			# not reverse alphabetical, just reversed the original list order

# LENGTH OF A LIST
	Find the length of a list using the function len()
		len(listname)

# LIST OF NUMBERS
	The function range() generates a series of numbers
		for number in range(1, 5)
			print(number)
				# 1 to 4 will be printed

		range(<start>, <end>, <step size>)
			start is inclusive, optional
			end is exclusive, required
			step size: for example, if this is 2, range() will count every 2
				numbers

	The function list() will convert arguments to a list
		print(list(range(1, 6)))
			# This will print [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

	The function min(<list name>) returns the lowest number in the list
	The function max(<list name>) returns the highest number in the list
	The function sum(<list name>) returns the sum of all the numbers in the list

# LIST COMPREHENSION
	Combines for loop and creation of new elements in one line
		squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)]
		print(squares)
			# This prints the square of the numbers from 1 to 10

		listname = [<expression> <for loop>]

# PARTS OF LISTS
	Slice				: a specific part of a list

		names = ["name1", "name2", "name3", "name4"]

		print(names[0:3])
			# This will print the elements at indexes 0, 1, and 2

		print(names[2:4])
			# This will print the elements at indexes 2 and 3

		print(names[:3])
			# This will print the elements at indexes 0, 1, and 2

		print(names[1:])
			# Print from index 1 to end of list

		print(names[-2:])
			# Print from the second to the last item up to the last item

		print(names[0:4:1])
			# Print from index 0 to index 3 while skipping 1 item between
			# items
	
	Looping through a slice
		for name in names[:3]:
			print(name)
				# Print each element up to index 2

# COPYING A LIST
	Create a slice from the start of the list up to the end by omitting the indexes
		names[:]
			# This creates a copy of the list

# TUPLES
	Immutable lists
	Tuples can't be modified but they can be written over
	Parentheses instead of square brackets

	Tuples with only 1 element should be defined like so:
		sample = (5,)
			# The comma is required even if there is only 1 element

	Tuples can be written over
		sample = (1, 2, 3)
		sample = (4, 5, 6)
			# The example above is valid

		sample (1, 2, 3)
		sample[0] = 5
			# The attempt to reassign sample[0] will produce an error

# LOOPS
	for loops
	In the example below, the for loop will take an element from the list names and
		associate that with the variable name until there is no more in the list

		names = ["name1", "name2", "name3"]

		for name in names:
			print(name)
				# Indented lines are inside the for loop

# IF STATEMENTS
	Example:
		if variable == "string":
			# line/s of code
		elif variable == "string2":
			# line/s of code
		elif variable == "string3":
			# line/s of code
		else:
			# line/s of code

	If the name of a list is used as a conditional test, it will return True if it
		has at least one element. Otherwise, False

		listname = [1, 2, 3]
		if listname:
			# line/s of code here will be executed since listname has at
			# least one element

# AND, OR
	and
		True if all conditions are True, otherwise False
			(variable1 == 2) and (variable2 == 4)
	
	or
		True if one or more conditions are True, otherwise False
			(variable1 == 2) or (variable2 == 4)

# IN, NOT
	in
		Can be used to check if a value is in a list
			listname = [1, 2, 3]
			4 in listname
				# This will return False

	not
		Check if a value is not in a list
			listname = [1, 2, 3]
			4 not in listname
				# This will return True

# METHODS
	Actions that can be performed on data

	Usage encountered so far:
		variable.method()

	.title()			: change each word to Title Case
	.upper()			: change to upper case
	.lower()			: change to lower case
	.rstrip()			: remove extra whitespace to the right of string
	.lstrip()			: remove extra whitespace to the left of string
	.strip()			: remove extra whitespace on both sides of string
	.removeprefix()			: remove specified character/s
		variable = 'https://www.samplesite.com'
		variable.removeprefix('https://')
		This will print www.samplesite.com

	.removesuffix()			: works the same as removeprefix(), but for suffixes
	.append()			: add to end of list
					: can also add elements to empty list
	.insert()			: add elements to any position in a list
	.pop()				: remove item in specified index from list and make
						available for use
	.remove()			: remove item from list using value, not idex
	.sort()				: sort permanently, default is alphabetical
	.reverse()			: reverse order of the list (different from
						reverse alphabetical sort)

# STATEMENTS
	Usage encountered so far:
		statement list[index]

	del listname[<index>]		: delete element at specified index number

# FUNCTIONS
	Usage encountered so far:
		print(function(list))

	sorted()			: prints sorted list but doesn't affect actual
						arrangement
	len()				: get list length
	range()				: takes 3 arguments, start at first argument, ends
						at 2nd argument - 1, 3rd argument is step
						size
	list()				: convert to list
	min()				: returns lowest number
	max()				: returns highest number
	sum()				: returns sum of all numbers in list
