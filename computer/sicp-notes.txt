# ELEMENTS OF PROGRAMMING
	Primitive expressions			: represent the simplest entities in the language
						: examples below:
							numbers, primitive procedures

	Means of combination			: used to build compound elements from simpler
							ones
						: examples below:
							primitive procedures such as +, -, etc.

	Means of abstraction			: used to manipulate compound elements as units
							with names

	Procedures				: rules for manipulating data

	Data					: stuff that we want to manipulate using
							procedures

	Global environment			: memory that keeps track of name-object pairs
							(variables?)

	Combinations				: example below:
							(+ 1 2)
						: compound expressions represent the application
							of the procedure to the numbers in the
							example above

	Prefix notation				: placing the operator before the operands
