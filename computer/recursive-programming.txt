# BASIC CONCEPTS OF RECURSIVE PROGRAMMING
	Recursions
		Depend on function calls and the call stack
		Something which includes itself in its definition
		A function that calls itself

	Frame objects
		Contain information about a single function call
		Gets pushed onto or popped off stacks

	Maximum recursion depth
		Depends on programming language
		The limit of number of recursive function calls

	Base case
		A condition which causes the recursive function to stop calling recursively

	Recursive functions require a recursive case and a base case

	Get subproblem with smaller size than the original problem
	Decompose the original problem into a smaller one
