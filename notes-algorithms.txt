# BIG O NOTATION
	Not an exact measurement, generalizes growth of algorithms
	Used to categorize algorithm time or memory requirements based on input
	Informs about the performance of algorithms and data structures

	How does the growth of the input affect performance and memory requirement?
	
	O			: worst case
	Capital theta		: best case (lower bound) and worst case (upper bound) are the same
	Constants are cancelled out

	EXAMPLE 1 ( Linear, or O(n) )
		Take a string and iterate over it
		For every unit of the string, the loop has to be executed again
		The growth is LINEAR

	EXAMPLE 2 ( O(1) )
		Reading from an array takes the same number of steps no matter the size of input
